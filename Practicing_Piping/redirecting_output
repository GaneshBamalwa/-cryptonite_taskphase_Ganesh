# CTF Challenge: redirecting_output

## Table of Content

- commands-executed: echo PWN > COLLEGE
- flag : pwn.college{MdR1tbLBVGnLT2AC6yjMI3m6StG.dRjN1QDLzETN0czW}



### Objective:
First, let's look at redirect stdout to files. You can accomplish this with the > character, as so:

hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi > asdf
This will redirect the output of echo hi (which will be hi) to the file asdf. You can then use a program such as cat to output this file:

hacker@dojo:~$ cat asdf
hi
In this challenge, you must use this input redirection to write the word PWN (all uppercase) to the filename COLLEGE (all uppercase).

### Output:
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your 
flag:
pwn.college{MdR1tbLBVGnLT2AC6yjMI3m6StG.dRjN1QDLzETN0czW}
