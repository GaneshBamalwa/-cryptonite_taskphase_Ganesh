# CTF Challenge: more catting practice

## Table of Content

- commands-executed: cat /usr/share/games/flag
- flag :pwn.college{gaYoO9LSBefeXidDlpze6cF8sUt.dBjM5QDLzETN0czW}



### Objective:

You can specify all sorts of paths as arguments to commands, and we'll practice some more with cat. In this level, I'll put the flag in some crazy directory, and I will not allow you to change directories with cd, so no cat flag for you. You must retrieve the flag by absolute path, wherever it is.

### Output:

You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by 
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it 
in the file /usr/share/games/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into that 
directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cd /usr/share/games/flag
You used 'cd'! In this level, I don't allow you to change the working directory 
--- you MUST chase pass 'cat' the absolute path of where I put it on the 
filesystem (which is /usr/share/games/flag).
