# CTF Challenge: touching files  

## Table of Content

- commands-executed: touch /tmp/pwn , touch /tmp/college , /challenge/run
- flag : pwn.college{s0KBK9gNg1vYMBIgtFWY3tH-sx8.dBzM4QDLzETN0czW}



### Objective:
Of course, you can also create files! There are several ways to do this, but we'll look at a simple command here. You can create a new, blank file by touching it with the touch command:

hacker@dojo:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ touch pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$
It's that simple! In this level, please create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college, and run /challenge/run to get your flag!

### Output:
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/college
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{s0KBK9gNg1vYMBIgtFWY3tH-sx8.dBzM4QDLzETN0czW}
