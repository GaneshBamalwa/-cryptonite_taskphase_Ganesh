### Objective:
The Linux filesystem has tons of directories with tons of files. You can navigate around directories by using the cd (change directory) command and passing a path to it as an argument, as so:

hacker@dojo:~$ cd /some/new/directory
hacker@dojo:/some/new/directory$ cd /some/new/directory
This affects the "current working directory" of your process (in this case, the bash shell). Each process has a directory in which it's currently hanging out. The reasons for this will become clear later in the module.

As an aside, now you can see what the ~ was in the prompt! It shows the current that your shell is located at.

This challenge will require you to execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you). You'll need to cd to that directory before rerunning the challenge program. Good luck!


### Output:
acker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd ../
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/home$ cd ../
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/$ cd /challenge/
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/challenge$ ./run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/build-essential directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/challenge$ cd /usr/share/build-essential
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/share/build-essential$ ls
essential-packages-list  list
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/share/build-essential$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
