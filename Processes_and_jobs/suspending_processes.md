### Output
hacker@processes~suspending-processes:~$ /challenge/run 
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running in 
this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         320     298  0 04:48 pts/0    00:00:00 bash /challenge/run

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me and launch me again! You can 
background me with Ctrl-Z or, if you're not ready to do that for whatever 
reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
